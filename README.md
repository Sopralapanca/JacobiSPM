# Parallel Jacobi

A comparison between different parallel implementations of the Jacobi algorithm for determining the solutions of a system of linear equations.


## Implementation

The parallel versions of this algorithm that have been implemented are:

1. The rows of the matrix are divided one by one by workers in a cyclic manner.
2. The matrix is divided by chunks of continuous rows, each chunk is assigned to a worker.
3. The matrix is divided by chunks and thread pinning is also used.
4. Parallel implementation using FastFlow library.

A sequential version of the program has also been implemented to perform comparisons.

## Compiling and running

A Makefile was created to compile the various versions. To create the executable files, it is possible to execute the rule

```bash
    make all
```

To run an experiment, it is possible to launch the program and pass the necessary arguments. An example is the following

```bash
    ./sequential.out matrix_size number_of_iterartions check_flag
    ./parallel_chunks_barrier.out matrix_size number_of_iterartions number_of_threads check_flag
``` 

where

- **matrix_size**: is the length of the matrix and vector. A matrix of size matrix_size*matrix_size and a vector of length matrix_size will be created.
- **number_of_iterations**: Number of iterations to be performed for Jacobi's method.
- **nw**: Degree of parallelism to be used.
- **check_flag**: Boolean for testing purposes [0] => information on the linear system will not be printed on the console [1] => information on the linear system will be printed on the console.

To run all experiments at once run the file execute.sh

```bash
    ./execute.sh
``` 

To create speedup, completion time and other tables with useful information, run the python script

```bash
    ./compute_stats.py
``` 

## Results

Below are some results for completion time and speedup with matrixes of size 5000*500
